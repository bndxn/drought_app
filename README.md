# drought_app
Goal: 

* To forecast drought in the UK
* To deploy a ML model to a web application

Questions

* What defines drought? Is there a way to predict it? 



Stages

* Use an API to get data for weather stations in the UK and make a map with plotly
* Identify an ML task - e.g. forecasting waterflow, maybe clustering of different locations to see if they're similar
* Train the model and save it on GCP, then call it via another API 

Data sources:

* Environment agency rainfall API [link](https://environment.data.gov.uk/flood-monitoring/assets/demo/index.html)

* DEFRA hydrology API - water flow information [link](https://environment.data.gov.uk/hydrology/doc/reference).
